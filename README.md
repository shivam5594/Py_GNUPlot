# Py_GNUPlot
This is a python script to automate GNUPlot scripting. GNUPlot script is not really user friendly. It requires a good reading of manual. 
This python script is just to automate the basic functionalities like plotting Comma separated value (.CSV) files.

# Environment
Tested and developed on windows 10. Also works with linux terminals on windows but need to change the path of files accordingly while using this.

# Limitations
-	It can plot one graph at a time. Working on multiple plots in same window.
-	It can plot only CSV files
-	2D graphs support
-	it is less user friendly, but hey, better than GNUPlot. Try it.
-	you have to run GNU script separatly. Working on running GNU script from python.
-	Not so readable graph labels, working on reading colomn heads from CSV files.

# what to do of GNU script / HOW to use it
Install GNUPLot and run its executable in command line like gnuplot.exe {path to your gnu script generated by python}
